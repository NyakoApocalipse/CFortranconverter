# Fortran to C++ Converter 1.0.0 
For project introduction and steps to build and install, refer to [CFortranTranslator](https://github.com/CalvinNeo/CFortranTranslator).

In this work, we try to add more features in fortran to the work of [YHN](https://github.com/YHN-ice/CFortranTranslator):
1. Add fortran-style string(or we say CHARACTER) implementation in C++, now we can use len() and other functions in fortran to operate strings.
